=== Author ===
These following programs are written by Angie Chen, in July-August 2021.
  - mainScript.py
  - script2.py
  - generateNames.py
  - mainScript2.py


=== Compatibility ===
See README.txt


=== Instructions ===
The file you will want to use is mainScript2.py. It is a modified version of mainScript.py and should be slightly more automated and less documentation.

Start by downloading mainScript2.py. Open up the python shell. Select File, Open, and find mainScript.py. A window named mainScript2.py should pop up. Ensure all your necessary files are in the same folder as the program (csv files, mainScript2.py, names.txt, files.txt).

Files.txt should be filled with the general name (ex. Users) in each line, with no other characters. Ensure there is no extra whitespace aside from the newlines.

Please note: files will be written in the format zNew-[files.txt line].csv. Files will be automatically overwritten if there is any with the same name.

Either click F5 or select Run, then Run Module. The program will let you know once each file is created. Unlike mainScript.py, there will be no other status updates.


=== Known Bugs ===
See README.txt


== Background Information ==
This program takes the list of files written in files.txt and uses them to go through all the programs automatically. 

This is essentially the same as mainScript.py, except with less status updates and automates a bit more.

See README.txt for more details
